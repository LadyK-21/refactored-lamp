## Description

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.

By default, the only things removed are:

- Containers for services defined in the Compose file
- Networks defined in the networks section of the Compose file
- The default network, if one is used

Networks and volumes defined as external are never removed.

Anonymous volumes are not removed by default. However, as they donâ€™t have a stable name, they will not be automatically
mounted by a subsequent `up`. For data that needs to persist between updates, use explicit paths as bind mounts or
named volumes.
