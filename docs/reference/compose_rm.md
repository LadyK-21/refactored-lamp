## Description

Removes stopped service containers.

By default, anonymous volumes attached to containers are not removed. You can override this with `-v`. To list all
volumes, use `docker volume ls`.

Any data which is not in a volume is lost.

Running the command with no options also removes one-off containers created by `docker compose run`:

```console
$ docker compose rm
Going to remove djangoquickstart_web_run_1
Are you sure? [yN] y
Removing djangoquickstart_web_run_1 ... done
```
